<p>&nbsp;Before starting to construct any extension cord, I want to tell you that there are many ways by which you can create your extension cord. You just have to find out which will be good for your electric equipment. Here, I am going to tell you the simplest way to make your extension cord. Let's start Constructing an Extension Cord.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Constructing an Extension Cord</h3>
<p>The first step is the most important step when we are working with electricity. Disconnect electricity with all wires.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Constructing an Extension Cord</h3>
<p>The second step is to take an electric cord. Measure it as per your need and cut it from both sides and peel their wires out.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Constructing an Extension Cord</h3>
<p>After peeling the edges of the wire you have to attach a Male Electric plug on the side and a Female Electric plug on the other side.</p>
<p>It is very easy to attach the plug with the wire. I know that you can do that by yourself. But if you don't know then read the next paragraph.</p>
<p>Firstly, you have to open the plug by using a screwdriver. After that, one side of the wire. Each side should have two wires. Attach these wires with the screw, into the plug. Then, do the same with the other side of the wire and with another plug.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Test it.</h3>
<p>Now you have the Extension Cord. Put the Male-Electrical Plug into the switchboard and attach your electrical equipment with the Female plug side of the Extension Cord. And, turn on the electric flow.</p>
<p>By using these simple steps you can make your Extension Cord at home. But, if you still having a problem with that or with any other electric work you can call our professional electrician for your work. Visit Wodoworker.</p>
