<p><strong>Our PM emphasized the need for India to recognize the importance of Local manufacturing, Local markets, and Local supply chains and emphasized on how they become the saviours of our country during Pandemic. He also said that COVID-19 taught India the importance of being Local. He also highlighted that all the today’s brands also started as local brands, and now have become leading brands after people started acknowledging them. If we do not support local, it means we are suppressing their chance to become leading brands. So our PM told us to be, ‘Vocal about Local’.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>As WODO is promoting local services, WODO is directly or indirectly creating an opportunity for local workers to get hired, contributing in fighting unemployment. WODO is helping customers find worker at a local level. This will result in the local services to get competitive and in turn get better. We are promoting&nbsp; services in your local region for your work. We are providing local public with a chance to expand their work at bigger but local level. As the services will be expanding rapidly, the quality of the service will improve exponentially as a result. This will help to get trust and support from consumers at different levels. And this will in turn automatically ban lower grade services and help local services get to a bigger and better platform. Which is the motive of ‘Vocal about Local’ campaign and WODO is meant to accomplish that motive.&nbsp;</strong></p>
